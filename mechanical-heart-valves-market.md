<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Heart Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Without Conduit</li><li>With Conduit</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The mechanical heart valves market can be categorized into two main types: without conduit and with conduit. Valves without conduit are standalone devices designed for direct implantation into the heart, often used in cases where the natural structure is intact. In contrast, valves with conduit are integrated into a pathway, often used in situations requiring additional support for blood flow or when there are congenital heart defects. Both types aim to restore proper heart function and improve patient outcomes.</p></p>
