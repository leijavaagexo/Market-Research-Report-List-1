<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Car Bias Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ordinary Bias Tires</li><li>Bias Belted Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The car bias tire market comprises two main types: ordinary bias tires and bias belted tires. Ordinary bias tires feature intersecting plies that provide a flexible sidewall but can cause uneven wear and less stability at high speeds. In contrast, bias belted tires incorporate additional belts, improving strength and stability while maintaining the bias ply's flexibility. This advancement enhances performance, particularly in terms of handling and tread life, making bias belted tires a preferred choice for many drivers seeking better control and durability.</p></p>
